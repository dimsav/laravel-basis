# Laravel App Basis

This is an bootstrap project containing all the steps I do before starting a new project. 
The goal is to speed this process up and ultimately automate it.

### Installation

- Run composer install
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`
- Run `php artisan app:name Some\\Namespace`
- Add project in circleci.com
